This is the code repository for Authd OpenID Connect (OIDC) brokers. It is used in conjunction with Ubuntu authentication daemon [authd](https://github.com/ubuntu/authd).

This project contains specific code for different OpenID Connect providers. We build one binary for each and snap them based on build tags to integrate with the Ubuntu authentication daemon.

For general details, check the authd [getting started guide](https://canonical-authd.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/). The same documentation reference hosts [installation](https://canonical-authd.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/howto/install-authd/) and [configuration](https://canonical-authd.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/howto/configure-authd/) instructions.

## Troubleshooting

More details on troubleshooting one of the OIDC brokers is available on the [authd documentation](https://canonical-authd.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/reference/troubleshooting/).
